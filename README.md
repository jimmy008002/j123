Motion control method

Pose name

hand up in 90 degrees = jump

left legs up= walk left

right legs down= walk right

stands = do mothing


This project aims to implement a gaming console to encourage the elderly and patients with Ortega disease to get into the habit of exercising regularly. In this report, we will apply an existing model- MoveNet which is a pose estimation model to help us collect data. And according to the x,y coordinate to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a pose train a classification model. The gaming console adopts MoveNet for real-time motion tracking and sends it to the classification model and interacts with users after the analyzed result from the pose.
